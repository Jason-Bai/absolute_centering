      I'm not the pioneer of this method (yet I have dared to name it Absolute Centering), and it may even be a common
      technique, however, most vertical centering articles never mention it and I had never seen it until I dug through
      the comments section of a particular article.

      There, Simon linked to this jsFiddle that blew every other method out of the water (the same method was also
      mentioned by Priit in the comments). Researching further, I had to use very specific keywords to find some other
      sources for this method.

      Having never used this technique before, I put it to the test and discovered how incredible Absolute Centering
      really is.
